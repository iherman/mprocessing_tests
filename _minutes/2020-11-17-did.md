### 1. Agenda Review, Introductions, Re-introductions
{: #section1}

> *Drummond Reed:* Introduction from Ted Thibodeau (Tall Ted) - has been active at W3C for many years, recovering from colon cancer

> *Drummond Reed:* Agenda review: recap of F2F, PRs, patent policy decision, editors presenting the plan moving forward with priority 1 and 2 issues, then priority 1 issues

**Manu Sporny:** does that include the PRs that have gone in for the data model  

**Daniel Burnett:** Brent will cover those first  

### 2. Special Topic Call
{: #section2}

> *Drummond Reed:* Special topic call will be Thursday at noon ET, the topic will be on equivalence properties

### 3. Face to Face Meeting Recap
{: #section3}

**Brent Zundel:** F2F was two weeks ago. Very productive sessions. Covered privacy concerns, abstract data model, translation between representations...  

> *Brent Zundel:* [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RoE8E4y8S1j65EJaXZ8oihkduNbjTXXvdwtkzw961Xw/edit#slide=id.p1](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RoE8E4y8S1j65EJaXZ8oihkduNbjTXXvdwtkzw961Xw/edit#slide=id.p1)

**Brent Zundel:** how DIDs are being used today, went into new patent policy  

> *Brent Zundel:* [https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/Meetings/Minutes/resolutions](https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/Meetings/Minutes/resolutions)

**Brent Zundel:** that link is slide deck for all presentations during the F2F  
… and the page where all the resolutions are registered  
… resolved to add language to the spec to avoid privacy-violating properties  
… we got much more concrete about what it means to ignore unrecognized properties  

**Justin Richer:** I think it was really good for the group to be forced into concrete details about what it means to ignore a property  
… it brought out a lot of assumptions  
… so it resulted in a path that nobody is completely happy with but we can all live with  

### 4. PRs 
{: #section4}

_See github pull request [#1](https://github.com/iherman/mprocessing_tests/issues/1)._

<!-- issue https://github.com/iherman/mprocessing_tests/issues/1 -->



**Justin Richer:** a number of the resolutions resulted in two PRs  
… 454 adds language about representation syntax that explains why properties for those  
… this PR proposes language for the spec that clarifies that  
… this PR has resulted in good conversation and has pretty wide approval so far  
… so we would like to accept this PR as a good step forward  

**Daniel Burnett:** normally with PRs we give a 7 day review window, however in this case we need this PR to move forward  

**Manu Sporny:** We have a lot of positive reviews. I could quickly review it in 5 minutes.  
… just noting that we have a lot more support for these PRs that we've had before. The editors are happy with them and I'm seeing a lot of alignment.  

**Daniel Burnett:** Can we first see if there are any objections to merging?  
… Is there anyone who would object to merging PR 454?  

**Michael Jones:** I would object without some editorial corrections  

**Daniel Burnett:** maybe we should talk about patent policy first  

**Jonathan Holt:** PR 454 is still too abstract  

**Daniel Burnett:** please add that comment to the PR  

**Ivan Herman:** Since that PR puts in writing what was decided and resolved at the F2F. If it faithfully represents the decision at the F2F, then it should be merged.  

> *Amy Guy:* +1 what ivan says

> *Markus Sabadello:* +1 to ivan. Note that we can also merge and then make additional improvements afterwards (e.g. regarding terminology).

**Daniel Burnett:** agrees  

**Michael Jones:** The problem is that the PR does not faithfully reflect what was decided. It deletes the language about unrecognized properties must be ignored.  
… If someone can go to the minutes and find the text, I will add that to the PR.  

> *Justin Richer:* I agree that this isn't sufficient but it's not meant to be complete yet. Same with the 455

> *Dave Longley:* selfissued, [https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/Meetings/Minutes/2020-11-05-did#resolution4](https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/Meetings/Minutes/2020-11-05-did#resolution4)

**Daniel Burnett:** thank you, that's good input, we'll return to this shortly  
… and the editors can think about how to move forward with that input  

> *Michael Jones:* There was an earlier meeting - I think a special topic call - in which we resolved something like "Properties that are not understood MUST be ignored". Can anyone locate that resolution?

> *Dave Longley:* selfissued, in the last meeting we all agreed "ignored" wasn't well defined, so we did this resolution: [https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/Meetings/Minutes/2020-11-05-did#resolution4](https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/Meetings/Minutes/2020-11-05-did#resolution4)

> *Dave Longley:* selfissued, that is the language that is in the PR now and it applies to all representations, not just JSON, hence the old confusing "ignored" language has been removed

> *Michael Jones:* I found it: [https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/Meetings/Minutes/2020-11-03-did#resolution2](https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/Meetings/Minutes/2020-11-03-did#resolution2) : "Unrecognized properties MUST be preserved."

> *Dave Longley:* selfissued, and that is now in 454 in a more explicit way: [https://github.com/iherman/minute_processing.json/pull/454/files#diff-0eb547304658805aad788d320f10bf1f292797b5e6d745a3bf617584da017051R2250-R2255](https://github.com/iherman/minute_processing.json/pull/454/files#diff-0eb547304658805aad788d320f10bf1f292797b5e6d745a3bf617584da017051R2250-R2255)

> *Dave Longley:* selfissued, and it covers all representations.

### 5. Patent Policy
{: #section5}

**Daniel Burnett:** we talked about this at the F2F about the new patent policy  

> *Dave Longley:* selfissued, we more clearly defined "ignore" and the new language is based on that

**Daniel Burnett:** we are encouraged by W3C to make a decision by the end of November  
… this is the proposal  
… is there anyone who has a question that must be answered before they can respond about this proposal?  

**Ted Thibodeau Jr.:** As the chairs will find in their email, he doesn't know that he can acquiesce to this because he's not the AC rep  

**Daniel Burnett:** each WG needs to make its determination about this.  
… Ivan, that's a good question  
… if a WG needs to adopt something, then it can be passed by a vote of members at a WG meeting  

**Ivan Herman:** We discussed it at the F2F meeting but did not act there so that WG members could talk to their AC rep.  
… you, Ted, are in a special situation  
… in general I would say that WG members had two weeks to discuss it with their AC reps  

**Ted Thibodeau Jr.:** As a policy, this is very broken process  

**Ivan Herman:** He can bring that back to the W3C management  

**Ted Thibodeau Jr.:** I researched this new policy and it was hard to find information  

**Ivan Herman:** This was discussed two weeks ago  

**Ted Thibodeau Jr.:** This is not the way this process should be set up.  

**Daniel Burnett:** This is all we as the WG can do. During the F2F meeting we provided a lot of information about the new patent policy.  
… I'd like to suggest that you talk with Phillipe.  

**Ted Thibodeau Jr.:** It's outside of scope for this meeting. Ivan, if you would bring this back to W3C. It is broken in many ways.  

**Ivan Herman:** The cleanest solution would be to recharter the WG.  

**Ted Thibodeau Jr.:** It should not be a WG vote. It should be the AC reps for each participant in the WG.  

**Ivan Herman:** The process is that if the WG decides that we want to go with the new patent policy, a separate process kicks in.  
… every member of the WG needs to rejoin the WG, which has to be approved by the AC rep.  
… so each AC rep can decide whether their organization will remain part of the WG or not.  
… to start this process, the WG needs to vote.  

**Ted Thibodeau Jr.:** It seems the default should be to remain with the 2017 patent policy.  

**Ivan Herman:** The group can decide to remain in the 2017 policy, and that is indeed the default. The group discussed the _possibility_ to move to 2020 two weeks ago.  

**Ted Thibodeau Jr.:** In trying to prepare for this call, I was looking for a diff file between the two policies?  

**Ivan Herman:** Brent did that comparison in the slides for the F2F meeting.  

> *Brent Zundel:* patent policy discussion starts at this slide: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RoE8E4y8S1j65EJaXZ8oihkduNbjTXXvdwtkzw961Xw/edit#slide=id.g9b7a7df111_1_47](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RoE8E4y8S1j65EJaXZ8oihkduNbjTXXvdwtkzw961Xw/edit#slide=id.g9b7a7df111_1_47)

**Daniel Burnett:** I would like to get a decision today.  

> *Ted Thibodeau Jr.:* +0 to proposal, pending feedback from AC Rep

**Daniel Burnett:** We could actually give a week for comments and responses.  
… We can always choose to adopt the policy later.  

**Ivan Herman:** Any decision we make today is only valid one week after the decision. So if someone objects in that time frame, the decision is rescinded.  

**Daniel Burnett:** If an objection occurs within the next week, the Chairs need to determine if there is consensus or not.

_See github issue [#3](https://github.com/iherman/minute_processing.json/pull/3), [#2](https://github.com/iherman/mprocessing_tests/issues/2)._

<!-- issue https://github.com/iherman/minute_processing.json/pull/3 https://github.com/iherman/mprocessing_tests/issues/2 -->



**Daniel Burnett:** Suggests that Manu take over the discussion of 454 and 455  

> *Brent Zundel:* +1 to manu taking over the PR discussion

**Manu Sporny:** Maybe all we need to discuss is Mike's concern  
… I believe the concern is with 455. But if we can move forward 454, then we can get to your concern in 455.  

**Michael Jones:** The text of two different resolutions needs to be included the approved resolutions. You can't omit those proposals and still have the full effect of the PR.  

> *Dave Longley:* [https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/Meetings/Minutes/2020-11-05-did#resolution4](https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/Meetings/Minutes/2020-11-05-did#resolution4)

**Dave Longley:** During the WG call, people were confused by the meaning of "ignore" and "preserve".  

> *Michael Jones:* [https://github.com/iherman/minute_processing.json/pull/454/#pullrequestreview-532550623](https://github.com/iherman/minute_processing.json/pull/454/#pullrequestreview-532550623)

**Dave Longley:** so we then got to another resolution (linked above)  

> *Manu Sporny:* I meant 455 -- 455 should be non-controversial (beyond the normal controversy).

**Dave Longley:** that's what got moved into the Representation Requirements section  
… so that's what is going into the PR  

**Michael Jones:** The text he cites. "Unrecognized properties must be preserved."  
… the other is that: "Note that the value of the `@context` member will be ignored if present."  
… the PR is not complete because it doesn't include those two statements. If you can apply those two, I'll change my review to approve.  

> *Dave Longley:* +1 to justin

> *Orie Steele:* +1 to justin

**Justin Richer:** I think it's important to note that this PR is moving language UP a level to where it belongs. This needs to be consistent across multiple representations.  

> *Manu Sporny:* +1 to justin

> *Dave Longley:* +1 fine with adding the note to another PR

**Justin Richer:** We need to have the note about `@context` in the JSON section.  
… if we can add that to this PR, let's just do it and move on.  

> *Dave Longley:* +1 yes, let's not the preserved language into the individual representation sections, agreed (i think the group agreed too)

> *Manu Sporny:* +1 please don't add that language back in... the new language is so much better.

**Justin Richer:** we absolutely must not add in the "unrecognized properties must be preserved" language SHOULD NOT be added back into the representation-specific sections because it belongs is in the overall requirements at that higher level.  

**Daniel Burnett:** Reminder to everyone that the PR needs to just reflect what we agreed to.  

> *Michael Jones:* I'm fine with "Unrecognized properties MUST be preserved." being added to the representation-independent section

> *Michael Jones:* This is [https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/Meetings/Minutes/2020-11-03-did#resolution2](https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/Meetings/Minutes/2020-11-03-did#resolution2)

**Jonathan Holt:** I think we have some outstanding issues about the ability to represent the abstract data model types.  

> *Brent Zundel:* that's PR 455

**Michael Jones:** I'm fine with the resolved language about "unrecognized properties must be preserved" being added to the Representation Requirements section.  

> *Justin Richer:* +1 for this new language

**Dave Longley:** This is why Resolution #4 was incorporated. It is more specific and applies to all representations.  

**Manu Sporny:** I'm not hearing any objections to PR 455. 454 builds on 455. These have been out for over a week now.  
… 455 has no controversy.  
… 455 applies a number of resolution that we made at the F2F.  

**Michael Jones:** The resolution to 454 is just to add the two sentences he proposed. I have not read 455 yet.  

**Daniel Burnett:** The week off last week was for meetings, not for PR review.  

**Manu Sporny:** 454 depends on language in 455. 455 is the first one that should go in.  

**Daniel Burnett:** let's go to 455.  

**Ivan Herman:** We are paying the price for having two different PRs. What I would do differently that normal, because there are no fundamental problems so far, is to merge both PRs now...  
… or to merge the two PRs to avoid the messiness.  

**Daniel Burnett:** let's look at 455 first  

**Justin Richer:** on 455, I left a comment about 40 mins ago that suggests a bit of tweaking for the property and type definitions. If that is accepted, I'm okay with this.  
… there's more to be done, but we can handle that in a future PR  
… but this will give us the ability to work on that specifically. So I support merging both of these and then "taking the hose to it" afterwards  

**Manu Sporny:** +1 to Justin's suggested changes. Some of those changes have already been made.  

**Michael Jones:** I just read 455 and I agree with Justin's proposed changes.  
… i think we should apply Justin's changes  

> *Justin Richer:* [https://github.com/iherman/minute_processing.json/pull/455/files#r525281650](https://github.com/iherman/minute_processing.json/pull/455/files#r525281650)

> *Brent Zundel:* +1 to applying Justin's suggested text

**Manu Sporny:** reading the changes now...  
… they are fine  

> *Dave Longley:* +1 to it

> *Dave Longley:* +1 to justin's change

**Justin Richer:** Yes, there was one specific change, very similar to what David Longley had as well.  

**Manu Sporny:** I have merged Justin's proposed changes in 455  

**Markus Sabadello:** We may want to improve the terminology about how we describe classes of properties. But we can do that after this PR is merged.

**Brent Zundel:** With both PRs, there is more to be done, but I don't object to any of the changes these PRs bring.  

> *Brent Zundel:* that is 454

> *Justin Richer:* that's 454 not 455

**Daniel Burnett:** Manu, please write the proposal

**Daniel Burnett:** now switch to 454.  

**Michael Jones:** Rather than delete the text, we need to make the change.  

**Justin Richer:** Should we raise new issues for specific suggestions?  

**Daniel Burnett:** please raise new issues  

> *Brent Zundel:* +1 to adding the text Mike is referring to

**Justin Richer:** I will do that  

**Daniel Burnett:** Any comments on Mike's request  

**Dave Longley:** Could the chairs comments on whether Resolution #4 superseded Resolution #2? The latter had newer language to resolve the problematic language in #2.

> *Dave Longley:* and [https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/Meetings/Minutes/2020-11-05-did#resolution3](https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/Meetings/Minutes/2020-11-05-did#resolution3) also moves everything to common place

**Daniel Burnett:** I believe that Resolution #4 further refines the text of Resolution #2.  
… Resolution #4 refines the text about consumption of an unknown property  
… The resolutions are not expected to be precise spec text...  
… so there can be additional text added  

**Michael Jones:** Two different comments. The harder one is that the general statement about preserving unknown properties that needs to go into the Representation Independent section.  
… but adding a note about `@context` should be in this section.  

**Daniel Burnett:** Resolution #4 is a refinement of what "ignore" means. So the text may be in different text.  

**Ted Thibodeau Jr.:** I believe that the explicit text change that was resolved should be applied as resolved. Then you can make another PR.  

**Daniel Burnett:** At the F2F, we were making statements of intent.  

> *Dave Longley:* +1 to justin, can selfissued just add a note in a PR?

**Justin Richer:** I believe the text in the PR reflects the intent. We can also add an informative note about `@context`.  

**Daniel Burnett:** We did discuss that at the meeting.  

**Michael Jones:** We took 15 minutes to agree to add a Note. We need to add the note before merging 454.  

**Daniel Burnett:** Sorry for not watching the time.  

> *Brent Zundel:* I've added a suggestion

> *Brent Zundel:* to the PR

**Daniel Burnett:** Editors: we did agree to add an informative note into that section, so we need to do that.
