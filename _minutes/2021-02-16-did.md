### 6. substantive PR-s
{: #section6}

> *Brent Zundel:* [https://github.com/w3c/did-core/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3Asubstantive](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3Asubstantive)

**Brent Zundel:** There are 3 substantive PRs to review today  
… these 3 PRs make substantive changes that either add or change normative text  
… so we want to be sure they have consensus  
… if you disagree with anything about these, please make constructive feedback  

**Manu Sporny:** There have been a flurry of PRs as part of the editors making a final editorial pass  
… everything through sections 1 to 5 have had a pass and are fairly stable  
… section 6 - the representation section - should be done this week  
… so close review of the first 5 sections is recommended  
… .the resolution section is still being reviewed/discussed  

#### 6.1. resolution testing 
{: #section6-1}

_See github pull request [#3](https://github.com/iherman/mprocessing_tests/pull/3)._

<!-- issue iherman/mprocessing_tests/3 -->



**Manu Sporny:** one issue with the resolution section is that it is abstract so we are still trying to figure out how to make it concrete enough to test  
… one approach is to say that the metadata structure that represents the abstract data model can be serialized so that it can then be translated into various representations  
… in order to do that we are suggesting a change to the abstract data model  
… up to this point it has only been about DID documents  
… but we are now considering making the abstract data model can represent other data structures that may be needed to create a specific representation  
… and then you can use the representation production rules in order to create a concrete representation  
… Markus and Justin have expressed some reservations about this  
… so we are open to discussing it  

**Markus Sabadello:** I understand the motivation to make things more testable...  
… but the intention was to make the DID resolution section abstract because concrete resolution protocols were out of scope  
… so it can be confusing to say that the abstract data model can be used for other things besides DID documents  
… so Markus would prefer that the abstract data model stays focused on DID documents and not include metadata structures  
… since metadata structures are "really something else"  

**Brent Zundel:** We have repeatedly used "testable" to be machine testable. However "testable" does not have to mean machine-testable.
